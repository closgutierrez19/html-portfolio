<h1>Best Movies to watch from Carlos' view</h1>
<h2>My go to list on a rainy day</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Scott Pilgrim VS the World</h3>
<p>This movie is already a cult classic.  I highly recommed the movie as it's artistic with it's clever use of CGI.
    It's witty banter always gets a chuckle out of me. 
</p>
<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>This one made it feel like a true Batman movie.  The scenes were amazingly shot.   All thanks to the keen eye of Matt Reeves. 
    If only I can experience this movie for the first time again. 
</p>
<h3>The Wild Robot</h3>
<p>Pixar really knocked it out of the part with this one.  But then again I really am an animal lover at heart.  It was beautiful to say the least. 
    Definitely a good family movie.
