<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Carlos Gutierrez.  I started my career in technology back in 2018.  I got an online certificate from the Google course.
  I started my journey with Life Fitness as a consultant and trouble shooting assistant.  After that role,  I was 
  able to find a role with my current employer but in a contractor position.  I was able to apply for a full time postion 
  at the begining of 2021.  Currntly still with Ulta Beauty as an IT Support Specialist.

<p>My current goal is to become a web designer and make it the next chapter in my career.  The field itself is amazingly intresting to me. 
  This merges both technology and art together.  I want to create works of art with the technology that we use today.  
  Making sure the user is engaged with the site and rising their eyebrow when they see something cool on their screen. 
  That's how I know I've made something worth while.

<p>My current hobbies are anything that allow me to work with my hands.  I love tinkering with my motorcycle, my 2005 Nissan Maxima, or just
  working small projects around the house.  If I do have any downtime, I will just play some video games. 
  It was one of my earliest passions to just play games.  I loved that games got clearer and smoother with the evolotion of technology.  
  Watching movies is definitely on the list of hobbies.  It serves as a get away from all
  the chaos from everyday life.
